            "1. Financial Performance: Vedanta's financial performance has been mixed over the past three years. While the company's total debt has increased significantly from 2019 to 2023, its tangible book value has decreased. This indicates that the company may be taking on more debt without generating sufficient tangible assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Working Capital: Vedanta has shown a negative working capital in 2023, indicating that the company may be facing liquidity issues. This can be a concern for investors as it may affect the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Equity and Capitalization: The company's common stock equity has remained relatively stable over the past three years. However, its total capitalization has decreased in 2023 compared to the previous year. This suggests that the company may be facing challenges in raising capital or attracting investors.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Total Assets: Vedanta's total assets have increased over the past three years, indicating growth in the company's asset base. However, it is important to note that a significant portion of these assets are non-current assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. This may limit the company's liquidity and ability to generate short-term returns.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Stock News: Recent news suggests that Vedanta's stock has experienced a decline of 0.65% in a weak market.

This indicates that the company may be exploring strategic options to improve its financial performance.\n",
